In MySQL there are three main data types: 
1.Numeric,
2.String,
3.Date and time.



1.Numeric Data Types:-


TINYINT(size):-

     A very small integer. Signed range  from -128 to 127. Unsigned range is from 0 to 255. The size parameter 
specifies the maximum display width (which is 255) Upto 4 digits.

SMALLINT(size):-	

    A small integer. Signed range is from -32768 to 32767. Unsigned range is from 0 to 65535. The size parameter 
specifies the maximum display width (which is 255) Upto 5 digits.

MEDIUMINT(size):-

    A medium integer. Signed range is from -8388608 to 8388607. Unsigned range is from 0 to 16777215. 
The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255) Upto 9 digits.

INT(size):-

     A medium integer. Signed range is from -2147483648 to 2147483647. Unsigned range is from 0 to 4294967295. 
The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255) Upto 11 digits.

BIGINT(size):-{Mainly used for Writing Account Number.}

	A large integer. Signed range is from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. Unsigned 
range is from 0 to 18446744073709551615. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255) Upto 20 digits.

BOOL:-
	Zero is considered as false, nonzero values are considered as true.

DECIMAL(size, d):-	
    An exact fixed-point number. The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after 
the decimal point is specified in the d parameter. The maximum number for size is 65. The maximum number for d is 30. 
The default value for size is 10. The default value for d is 0.

2.String Data Types:-

CHAR(size):-

	A FIXED length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters). The size parameter specifies the column 
length in characters - can be from 0 to 255. Default is 1.

VARCHAR(size):-

      A VARIABLE length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters). The size parameter 
specifies the maximum column length in characters - can be from 0 to 65535.

TEXT(size):- {Mainly used to review text area}
	Holds a string with a maximum length of 65,535 bytes.


 3.Date and Time Data Types:-

 DATE:-
 	A date. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. The supported range is from '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31' .  

DATETIME :- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

TIMESTAMP :- YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
